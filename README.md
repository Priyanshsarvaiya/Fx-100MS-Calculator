# Scientific Calculator in C++

## Overview

This project implements a **Scientific Calculator** using C++. The calculator performs a variety of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more. It provides a simple command-line interface for users to input expressions and receive results.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Advanced Functions**: 
  - Trigonometric functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent (in degrees)
  - Exponential and logarithmic functions: Natural logarithm (ln) and Logarithm (log10)
  - Square root and power functions
- **Integration**: Numeric integration for defined functions.
- **Derivative Calculation**: Find the derivative of a given function.
- **Permutations and Combinations**: Calculate permutations and combinations for given inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Getting Started
